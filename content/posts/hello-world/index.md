## Welcome

Hi, I'm **yagikota** -- an SRE / Platform Engineer. This is the first post on my new blog, and I want to share why I decided to start writing.

## Why Start a Blog?

As engineers, we solve complex problems every day. But most of that knowledge stays locked in our heads, scattered across internal docs, or buried in Slack threads. I started this blog to:

1. **Document what I learn** -- Writing forces me to understand things deeply
2. **Give back to the community** -- I've learned so much from other engineers' blogs
3. **Build in public** -- Share real-world experience, not just theory

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about topics I work with daily:

- **Kubernetes** -- Debugging, operations, best practices
- **Observability** -- Metrics, logs, traces, and making sense of production
- **Infrastructure as Code** -- Terraform patterns, GitOps workflows
- **SRE Culture** -- SLOs, incident management, post-mortems, error budgets
- **Platform Engineering** -- Building internal developer platforms

## The Tech Stack Behind This Blog

This blog itself is a good example of keeping things simple:

- **Hugo** -- Static site generator (fast, no runtime dependencies)
- **Blowfish theme** -- Modern, Tailwind CSS-based theme with dark mode
- **GitHub Pages** -- Free hosting with CI/CD via GitHub Actions
- **Cursor + AI** -- Writing and editing with AI assistance

Everything is managed as code in a Git repository. No databases, no servers to maintain -- just Markdown files and a build pipeline.

## What's Next

I have a few posts in the pipeline:

- My SRE toolkit and daily workflow
- A Kubernetes debugging cheatsheet
- Practical guide to SLOs and error budgets

Stay tuned, and thanks for reading.
