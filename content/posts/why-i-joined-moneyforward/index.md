## Introduction

Hi there! I'm [88888888_kota](https://twitter.com/88888888_kota), a 2024 new graduate who joined Money Forward as an engineer in April 2024.
I joined the CTO Office of Money Forward Business Company (MFBC) as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE).
In this post, I'll share why I chose Money Forward as a new grad and what I plan to accomplish here.

## My Background

Before getting to the main topic, here's a brief overview of my background. Feel free to skip ahead.

| Period | Affiliation |
| --- | --- |
| 2016/04 – 2019/03 | Mikunigaoka High School |
| 2019/04 – 2020/03 | Sundai Prep School (gap year) |
| 2020/04 – 2024/03 | Osaka Prefecture University |
| 2024/04 – Present | Money Forward |

- **High school (curiosity about space)**
  - I attended Mikunigaoka High School in Osaka.
  - The school had an annual overseas trip to NASA, and I joined the program. That sparked my interest in space.
  - I tried to get into a top university for space-related studies but didn't pass the entrance exam.
- **Gap year (turning point)**
  - After high school, I spent a year at Sundai prep school in Osaka.
  - During that time, I watched a Japanese suspense drama called "Your Turn to Kill" that featured a scene where AI was used to identify a criminal. That got me interested in programming.
  - I changed my target major to information science, entered the Electrical and Electronic Engineering department at Osaka Prefecture University, and started learning programming (HTML/CSS).
- **University (internships and job hunting)**
  - The moment I entered university, COVID hit. Instead of going to campus, I spent my days watching anime -- I got hooked on Sword Art Online, Re:Zero, and Railgun.
  - Between anime sessions, I studied programming. When I got bored with HTML/CSS, I picked up Python.
  - In the summer of my second year, I did my first internship. After that, I interned at various companies from startups to large tech firms, gaining practical experience. (Detailed work history on [Wantedly](https://www.wantedly.com/id/kouta_yagi_b).)
  - When job hunting season arrived, I walked into my first interview with nothing but a vague desire to "work at a famous company." I had received a fast-track invitation from the first company, so I assumed the interview would go fine -- I was promptly rejected.
  - That rejection forced me to seriously think about my engineering career strategy and what I wanted in a workplace. This was around autumn 2022.
  - I received my offer from Money Forward on March 7, 2023.
  - At university, I researched the impact of DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE) deployment on web performance. I graduated successfully.
- **Money Forward**
  - I joined on April 1, 2024.

## Why I Joined

Here's the main part. In short, Money Forward matched the criteria I had for my ideal company.

### My Criteria for Choosing a Company

1. **Is the company already operating globally, or aiming to expand overseas?**
   - Global presence was my most important criterion. I wanted to build services used by people around the world, not just in Japan. Working on global challenges means greater societal impact. On top of that, I wanted to work in English. English skills alone can dramatically expand your career options, and I was planning to eventually work abroad.

2. **Is the product good?**
   - Product quality mattered a lot. I wanted to work on products that I'd want to use myself -- products I'd recommend to my family and friends.

3. **Does the company make flexible technology decisions (modern tech stack)?**
   - In a world where technology evolves rapidly, I wanted to work at a company that chooses the best tools for the job rather than clinging to legacy tech. In other words, I wanted to use modern, cutting-edge technology -- specifically **Go, Rust, TypeScript, AWS, and Kubernetes**. I understand that technology is just a means to an end and these aren't always optimal, but personally, I want to develop with technologies I enjoy.

### Why Money Forward?

- **Alignment with MVVC (Mission, Vision, Values, Culture)**
  - I resonated with Money Forward's MVVC. By the time I interviewed, the MVVC had been updated to [its current form](https://recruit.moneyforward.com/mvvc). I particularly connected with the Values of "User Focus" and "Technology Driven" (now updated to "Tech & Design").

- **It matched my criteria**
  - Money Forward was already expanding into India and Vietnam, and even the Japan offices were becoming increasingly global. [About 40% of engineers are non-Japanese nationals](https://speakerdeck.com/mf_recruitment_pr/company-profile-for-new-graduate-engineers?slide=20). (Fun fact: more than half of 2024 new grad engineers were non-Japanese.)
  - I was also impressed by the products. I was already a Money Forward ME user and found it genuinely useful. I figured that a company making such a great consumer product would apply the same quality standards to its other products.
  - On the technology front, the stack was modern. When I was job hunting (around autumn 2022), I read an [article by CTO Nakade](https://moneyforward-dev.jp/entry/2021/12/30/5years-since-cto/) that mentioned increasing Go adoption. The fact that [AWS and Kubernetes were core infrastructure tools](https://speakerdeck.com/mf_recruitment_pr/company-profile-for-new-graduate-engineers?slide=17) was also a big plus.

## What I Plan to Do at Money Forward

- **Tech**
  - I was placed on the SRE team as I hoped, so I'll focus on delivering reliable services while improving developer experience and productivity. During university, I mainly did backend development in Go, so I'm starting with almost zero SRE knowledge -- but I'll leverage my ability to ramp up quickly. I'll write a separate post about why I chose SRE over backend.

- **English**
  - I'll work on improving my English communication skills. My team operates primarily in English, so I feel a real sense of urgency. Fortunately, Money Forward offers English learning support as a benefit, and I plan to make the most of it.

## Final Thoughts

As I start my career as an engineer, I first want to thank my family and friends who have supported me along the way.
I'm thrilled to be joining Money Forward as a new grad.
Stay tuned for what comes next!
