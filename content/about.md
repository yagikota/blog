## Hi, I'm yagikota

I'm an **SRE / Platform Engineer** passionate about building reliable, scalable infrastructure and developer platforms.

### What I Do

- Design and operate **Kubernetes**-based platforms
- Build **observability** stacks (metrics, logs, traces)
- Implement **Infrastructure as Code** with Terraform
- Drive **SRE culture** -- SLOs, error budgets, incident management
- Automate everything with **CI/CD pipelines**

### Why This Blog

I started this blog to share practical knowledge from real-world experience in site reliability and platform engineering. Expect deep dives into Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure, observability, and the culture side of SRE.

### Connect

Feel free to reach out through the social links above. I'm always happy to discuss SRE, platform engineering, or anything infrastructure-related.
