## Hi, I'm yagikota

I'm an **SRE / Platform Engineer** building reliable systems and the developer platforms that keep them running. My day-to-day involves Kubernetes, observability, and Infrastructure as Code for SaaS products backed by microservices architecture.

I started my career in backend development with Go, then deliberately moved into infrastructure and reliability engineering. I believe understanding the full stack — from application code to cluster operations — is what makes a well-rounded engineer.

### What I Specialize In

- **Kubernetes** — Cluster operations, custom controllers, and platform migrations
- **Observability** — Designing metrics, logging, and tracing stacks that make production understandable
- **Infrastructure as Code** — Terraform modules, GitOps workflows, and declarative configuration
- **SRE Culture** — Introducing SLI/SLO frameworks and data-driven reliability practices across engineering teams
- **CI/CD** — Building fast, cost-efficient pipelines that stay out of developers' way

### Problems I Like Solving

I'm drawn to work at the intersection of reliability and developer experience. If something is manual, fragile, or slowing teams down, I want to fix it.

That means building internal tools that let developers own their own reliability. It means replacing gut feelings with clear SLOs and error budgets. It means making infrastructure changes predictable — boring, even — in the best possible way.

### What I'm Exploring

I'm currently thinking about the evolving relationship between **platform engineering and SRE** — how internal developer platforms can treat reliability as a first-class concern. I'm also getting more involved in **open-source** contributions.

### Why This Blog

Most engineering knowledge lives in internal docs or gets lost in Slack threads. I started this blog to document what I learn from real-world production systems. Writing helps me think clearly, and if it helps someone else along the way, even better.

Expect posts on Kubernetes, cloud infrastructure, observability, and the human side of SRE.

Feel free to reach out through the social links above. I'm always happy to talk about SRE, platform engineering, or anything infrastructure-related.
